Imagine that your computer program loves these plants. 
Whenever it receives an input in the form of the word Spathiphyllum, 
it involuntarily shouts to the console the following string: 
    "Spathiphyllum is the best plant ever!"

From Lab 3.1.1.10 
'''
flower = input("What is the best plant? ")

while flower != "peonies":
    print("Nice try, but", flower, "isn't it. Try again!")
    flower = input("What is the best plant? ")

print("Yes,", flower, "is the best plant ever!")
